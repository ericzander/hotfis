Welcome
==================================

Create, alter, and visualize fuzzy inference systems in Python!

Description
===========

HotFIS is a library designed to support
`fuzzy logic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic>`_ through the
streamlined creation and evaluation of fuzzy inference systems (FIS) in Python.

In order to support machine learning and data science applications,
the library leverages `Numpy <https://numpy.org>`_ to evaluate both scalar and
array-like input via `Mamdani <https://doi.org/10.1016/S0020-7373(75)80002-2>`_
or `Takagi-Sugeno <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6313399>`_ inference.
Additionally, `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_ is employed to quickly
visualize output and support explainability.

Note: *HotFIS is currently in early development!* Any suggested
features and improvements are welcome.
